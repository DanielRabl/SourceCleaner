# SourceCleaner

A less safe version of SourceExtract, but a lot faster. Drag files on the .exe to remove all unnecessary Visual Studio files. Folder like ".vs", "Debug", "Release", "x64", "x86" are removed. If you execute the .exe alone, it will clean all folders in the current directory. It will try to clean the correct folders.
